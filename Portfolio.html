            <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>
                    I was born in France and moved to the states when I was little. While in middle school I joined my school's robotics club where I first started my coding journey in Scratch. 
                    I was fascinated in how simple blocks of commands can tell a machine to complete a task. I would later find out that is what programming is all about.
                </p>

                    I am an aspiring software developer that has interest and experience with a mix of different languages. Based in Florida I have had a passion for creating
                    and expressing myself through technology and code. Coding not only feeds this passion but allows for avenues in which I can help companies and/or 
                    communities reach their goals.
